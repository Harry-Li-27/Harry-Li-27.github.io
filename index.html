        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="section-container">
            <p>
                Yuecheng Li's main work lies in Computer Vision and Deep Neural Networks. 
                He is currently a research assistant under Professor Laurent Itti’s supervision at USC. 
                He helped to develop an algorithm that can be used for both transfer learning and continual learning. 
                On a huge dataset that contains 53 tasks, 1583 classes, and 146488 images, 
                the algorithm reaches an average accuracy of 86.25% vs. 81.53% which is H2T's result 
                (algorithm developed by google) in transfer learning and 74.83% (DERPP's result) in continual learning. 
                Another highlight of the algorithm is that it only uses 0.59% extra parameters compared to the backbone model. 
                Yuecheng Li also defined a multi-agent life-long learning problem in which multiple agents learn different knowledge 
                in different locations and shared the knowledge with each other along with a solution for the problem. 
                A dataset is created, which contains >100 tasks and ~3,000,000 images with different classification purposes 
                (e.g. scene classification, object classification, counting, etc.) and various task sizes 
                (small tasks only contain ~100 images and large tasks contain ~300,000 images). 
                The solution achieves an average accuracy of 60% with low memory cost and training time while adapting 
                other appropriate and strong algorithms to the task can only reach 32%.
